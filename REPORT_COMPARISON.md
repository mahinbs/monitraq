# Medical Report Comparison: Real vs AI-Generated

## Real Medical Report Structure (MRI Pituitary and Brain)

### Header Information
- **Patient Name:** MOUMITA PHOUZDER
- **Patient ID:** H4730
- **Modality:** MRI
- **Sex:** FEMALE
- **Age:** 39Y
- **Study:** PITUITARY
- **Reff. Dr.:** DR. M. BANERJEE
- **Study Date:** 24/08/2025

### Technique Section
```
Routine fast sequences were performed in multiple planes to evaluate the brain.
A dynamic contrast-enhanced study of the pituitary gland was performed during the rapid bolus injection of a standard dose of Gadolinium-DTPA.
A delayed (150 seconds) Volume interpolated (3D GR sequence) was also obtained.
```

### Findings Section
```
A well-defined hypoenhancing lesion measuring 7x4 mm is noted in the right half of the pituitary gland.
On dynamic scan, this lesion shows delayed and steady enhancement compared to the normal pituitary gland.
The pituitary stalk is in the centre.
The posterior pituitary bright spot is seen and is in a normal location.
The optic chiasma is normal and is undisplaced.
```

### Impression Section
```
M.R.I. reveals:
Findings of a hypoenhancing, well-defined lesion in the right half of the pituitary gland, suggestive of pituitary microadenoma.
```

### Additional Notes
- "Please correlate clinically."
- "Thanks for the referral,"
