# üîß Enhanced Report Integration Fix - Complete!

## üö® **Problem Identified & Resolved**

### **‚ùå What Was Wrong**
The enhanced AI report generator was created and working, but **NOT integrated** with the web interface. Users were still seeing the old basic pathology reports with:
- Generic findings like "inflammatory_changes" (491 files)
- Suspicious data patterns
- Low clinical relevance
- Missing professional medical terminology

### **‚úÖ What Was Fixed**
1. **Frontend Integration**: Modified `pelvis_test.html` to display enhanced reports
2. **JavaScript Enhancement**: Added logic to store and display enhanced reports
3. **Fallback System**: Added button to manually generate enhanced reports if needed
4. **Priority Display**: Enhanced reports now take priority over basic pathology summaries
