# AI System Improvement Action Plan

## Executive Summary
Based on the comparison between AI-generated and doctor's reports, this document outlines a comprehensive action plan to address critical deficiencies in the AI system's clinical interpretation capabilities.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **AI Missed Clinically Significant Findings**
- **Problem:** AI failed to identify actual hematomas (primary clinical findings)
- **Impact:** Generated irrelevant generic pathologies instead of actionable clinical information
- **Risk:** Misleading clinical decisions, missed diagnoses

### 2. **Generic Pathology Detection**
- **Problem:** AI detects broad categories like "inflammatory_changes" without specificity
- **Impact:** No clinical correlation with patient's actual condition
- **Risk:** False positives, clinical confusion

## Detailed Improvement Areas
