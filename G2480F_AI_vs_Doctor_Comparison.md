### **2. CLINICAL CONTENT COMPARISON**

#### **üî¨ TECHNIQUE SECTION**
**AI Report:**
```
MRI examination of the pelvis was performed using a comprehensive imaging protocol 
including T1, T2, DWI, GRE sequences. With and without contrast imaging was obtained 
with appropriate slice thickness and imaging planes.
```

**Real Doctor Report:**
```
MRI PELVIS with T1, T2, DWI, GRE sequences with and without contrast
```

**‚úÖ Assessment**: AI provides **more detailed** and **professional** technique description

#### **üîç FINDINGS SECTION**
**AI Report:**
```
Normal anatomical structures are visualized including the uterus, ovaries, bladder, 
and surrounding soft tissues. Bony structures including the sacrum, coccyx, ilium, 
ischium, and pubis appear normal.
```

**Real Doctor Report:**
```
Left paraovarian hematoma measuring 4.7 x 4.2 cm
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Assessment**: AI detected **normal anatomy** but missed the **specific pathology** (hematoma)

#### **üí≠ IMPRESSION SECTION**
**AI Report:**
```
No significant abnormalities are identified in the pelvis. Mild free fluid in the 
pelvis is noted. Please correlate clinically.
```

**Real Doctor Report:**
```
Left paraovarian hematoma. Please correlate clinically.
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Assessment**: AI missed the **primary finding** but correctly noted **clinical correlation**
