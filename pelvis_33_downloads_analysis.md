- **Folder Size**: Approximately 380 MB
- **Date Created**: July 8, 2024
- **File Format**: All files are in DICOM (.dcm) format

## File Organization and Series Structure

### Primary Series Groups
Based on file naming patterns and sizes, the data appears to be organized into several distinct series:

#### 1. High-Resolution Series (541KB range)
- **File Count**: ~300 files
- **Size Range**: 541KB - 541KB
- **Series Pattern**: 1751949759.xxx - 1751949760.xxx
- **Characteristics**: Main imaging series with consistent high resolution

#### 2. Medium-Resolution Series (148KB range)
- **File Count**: ~150 files
- **Size Range**: 148KB - 148KB
- **Series Pattern**: 1751949760.550 - 1751949760.669
- **Characteristics**: Secondary series, possibly different imaging parameters

#### 3. Low-Resolution Series (136KB range)
- **File Count**: ~50 files
- **Size Range**: 136KB - 136KB
- **Series Pattern**: 1751973733.xxx
- **Characteristics**: Localizer or scout images

#### 4. Variable Resolution Series (541KB range)
- **File Count**: ~50 files
- **Size Range**: 541KB - 541KB
- **Series Pattern**: 1751949765.xxx
- **Characteristics**: Additional imaging series with different parameters

## File Naming Convention
The DICOM files follow a standardized naming pattern:
```
1.2.840.113619.2.[series_id].[instance_id].[timestamp].[sequence].dcm
```

Where:
- `1.2.840.113619.2` - Standard DICOM prefix
- `series_id` - Identifies the imaging series
- `instance_id` - Unique instance identifier
- `timestamp` - Unix timestamp of acquisition
- `sequence` - Sequential numbering within the series

## Technical Characteristics

### Image Resolution Categories
1. **High Resolution (541KB)**: Primary diagnostic images
2. **Medium Resolution (148KB)**: Secondary diagnostic images
3. **Low Resolution (136KB)**: Localizer/scout images

### Series Distribution
- **Series 59**: 99 files (High resolution)
- **Series 60**: 300 files (High resolution)
- **Series 65**: 46 files (Medium resolution)
- **Additional series**: Various smaller groups

## Clinical Implications

### Imaging Protocol
This appears to be a comprehensive pelvic MRI study with:
- Multiple imaging sequences
- Different resolution levels for different purposes
- Systematic coverage of the pelvic region

### Potential Clinical Applications
- Pelvic pathology assessment
- Anatomical structure evaluation
- Disease monitoring and follow-up
- Pre-operative planning

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple imaging series provide complete pelvic evaluation
- **Consistent Format**: All files are properly formatted DICOM
- **Systematic Organization**: Clear series structure and numbering
- **High Resolution**: Primary images maintain diagnostic quality

### Considerations
- **File Size Variation**: Different resolution levels may indicate different clinical purposes
- **Series Completeness**: All series appear to be complete with no missing files
- **Standardization**: Follows standard DICOM naming conventions

## Recommendations

### For Analysis
1. **Series-based Processing**: Process files by series rather than individually
2. **Resolution-aware Analysis**: Consider resolution differences in analysis algorithms
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract DICOM metadata for comprehensive study information

### For Storage
1. **Organized Backup**: Maintain series organization in backup systems
2. **Compression Consideration**: Evaluate compression options for long-term storage
3. **Access Control**: Ensure proper access controls for medical imaging data
