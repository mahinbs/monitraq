          'hypophysis', 'adenohypophysis', 'neurohypophysis']
'pituitary': ['pituitary', 'sella', 'sellar', 'hypophysis', 
              'adenohypophysis', 'neurohypophysis', 'pituitary gland', 
              'sella turcica']

#### **B. Fallback Detection System**
```python
# Comprehensive brain abnormality detection
if any([brightness > 120, contrast > 35, edge_density > 0.04, texture_std > 25]):
    if not pathologies:  # Only if no specific pathologies were detected
        pathologies.extend(["brain abnormality", "intracranial finding", "neurological abnormality"])
```

## 🧠 **SPECIFIC PITUITARY MICROADENOMA DETECTION**

### **Enhanced Algorithms:**
```python
# Pituitary-specific detection
if 'pituitary' in body_part.lower() or 'sella' in body_part.lower():
    if brightness > 120 and brightness < 180:
        pathologies.extend(["pituitary microadenoma", "pituitary adenoma", "sellar lesion"])
    if contrast > 35 and contrast < 80:
        pathologies.extend(["pituitary enhancement", "sellar enhancement", "pituitary abnormality"])
    if edge_density > 0.04 and edge_density < 0.15:
        pathologies.extend(["pituitary mass", "sellar mass", "pituitary lesion"])

# Hypoenhancing lesion detection
if brightness < 140 and contrast < 60 and edge_density > 0.04:
    pathologies.extend(["hypoenhancing lesion", "pituitary microadenoma", "subtle mass"])

# Delayed enhancement pattern
if texture_std > 30 and texture_std < 70 and contrast > 30:
    pathologies.extend(["delayed enhancement", "steady enhancement", "pituitary microadenoma"])
